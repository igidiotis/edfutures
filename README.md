## Overview

The Education Futures Generator is an interactive web-based tool designed to stimulate creative and critical thinking about possible futures of education, particularly focusing on the socio-technical impact of AI on learning environments in the year 2045.

This tool is part of PhD research being conducted at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, exploring how educators and stakeholders imagine and conceptualize future learning scenarios.

## üîç Research Purpose

This generator serves as a data collection instrument for research on:
- How educators envision AI's role in future learning environments
- The socio-technical impacts of emerging technologies on education
- Stakeholders' hopes, concerns, and expectations about future learning spaces
- Creative approaches to educational foresight and scenario planning

By generating speculative scenarios and collecting user-submitted stories, this research aims to provide insights into collective imaginations about educational futures and help inform educational policy and design.

## üéÆ How It Works

The Education Futures Generator is based on "The Thing From The Future," an imagination game created by Situation Lab. It uses four key elements to structure speculative thinking:

1. **ARC**: Describes the type of future world where the scenario takes place
2. **OBJECT**: A specific "thing" that differentiates this future world from today
3. **TERRAIN**: The context or location in which the Object exists
4. **MOOD**: The emotional atmosphere evoked by this future scenario

Users generate random combinations of these elements and then develop short speculative stories about education in 2045 based on these prompts.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Random Scenario Generation**: Create unique future education scenarios with one click
- **Guided Writing Space**: Develop and refine your speculative stories with helpful prompts
- **Story Example**: View a sample story to understand how to connect the elements
- **Writing Suggestions**: Get inspiration specific to each element of your scenario
- **Save & Load**: Store your scenarios locally for later development
- **Research Submission**: Submit your stories to contribute to ongoing research
- **Copy & Share**: Easily save your work to share with others

## üìã Usage Instructions

1. Click "Generate Scenario" to get a combination of four cards
2. Click "Capture & Write" to begin developing your story based on these elements
3. Use the suggestion buttons if you need inspiration for specific elements
4. Write your story in the text area (set in the year 2045)
5. Save your work using the "Save Scenario" button
6. Submit your story to contribute to the research
7. Create as many scenarios as you wish!
